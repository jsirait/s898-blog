# 6.s898 Deep Learning - Final Project Blog Post
 
This blog post is written as a final project for the 6.s898 Deep Learning course at MIT. The blog is hosted at [https://jsirait.github.io/s898-blog/](https://jsirait.github.io/s898-blog/) or [https://jsirait.github.io/s898-blog//2021/12/09/s898-blog/](https://jsirait.github.io/s898-blog//2021/12/09/s898-blog/) (both link to the same post).
 
Technicalities:
 
1. This blog was built using a (slightly modified) version of the [ICLR Blog Track](https://iclr-blog-track.github.io//2021/08/13/a-call-for-blogposts/) template repository. Some changes:
   1. The homepage of `index.html` directly shows the blog post I wrote, instead of the original list of multiple posts, and I deleted the post templates originally found in `/_posts`.
   2. I made some additional changes to `_config.yml` to edit the blog title, `/_layouts/default.html` to only show my blog, and `/_layouts/post.html` in order to make the visual of the blog neat.
   3. I added some images to `/_public/images`.
   4. No other changes are made aside from these.
2. The content of the blog is in `/_posts/2021-12-09-s898-blog.md`. The file `index.html` directly renders this markdown file. The blog is hosted [here](https://jsirait.github.io/s898-blog/).
